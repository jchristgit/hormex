# Hormex
A simple HTTP server written in Elixir.

## Features / To Do
- [X] Basic Routing
- [ ] Filetype detection
- [ ] Good test coverage
- [ ] Custom configuration
- [ ] Live route changing - partially implemented, see `Hormex.Router`
- [ ] Correct handling of request headers

## Running
Simply use `mix run --no-halt` to run the server, and access it at `localhost:4040`.

## Naming
As with all my projects, I came up with the name by putting some animal into Google Translate and making it somewhat relate to the Language I wrote it in. Hormiga is Spanish for Ant.
